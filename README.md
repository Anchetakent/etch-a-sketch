##  Project Overview

This app recreates a digital Etch-A-Sketch experience where users draw by hovering (or clicking/dragging) over a grid of squares. The grid size can be adjusted dynamically, and users can draw freehand — producing pixel-style artwork directly in the browser. The goal is to practice and demonstrate core web development skills, especially **DOM manipulation and event-driven programming**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
